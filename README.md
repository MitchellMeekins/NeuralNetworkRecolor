# Neural Network Recoloring Predictor

This personal project implements a neural network-based color preference predictor using PyTorch and Tkinter. Users can provide feedback on color combinations, and the neural network predicts the likelihood of users liking the color combination.

## Features

- The neural network model is trained to interpret user feedback and predict color preferences.
- Users can provide feedback through a Tkinter GUI interface.
- The model dynamically updates based on user feedback to improve prediction accuracy.

## How to Use

1. Run the script `main.py`.
2. A Tkinter window will appear displaying a color combination.
3. Click on the buttons labeled "Love it", "Like it", "Meh", or "Hate it" to provide feedback on the color combination.
4. The neural network will be trained with the new feedback, and the predicted likelihood of liking the color combination will be updated accordingly.

- PyTorch
- Tkinter
